# DEVELOPMENT OF PID USING PSO ALGORITHM AND FUZZY LOGIC CONTROLLER: APPLICATION TO LOAD FREQUENCY CONTROL OF TWO AREA INTERCONNECTED SYSTEM
  The Main aim of the Project is to Optimize the parameters of Load Frequency
Control Using PSO Algorithm and Fuzzy Logic. There are many tuning algorithms
available for tuning the PID controller. Most of the tuning processes are implemented
manually. These processes are difficult and time consuming. Soft computing techniques
have been widely used to tune the parameters of PID. By using the parameters of PID
controller are tuned using soft computing technique which is Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) and Fuzzy Logic. The optimal PID control parameters are applied
for a composition control system. The performance of the technique is evaluated by
setting its objective function with Integral of Time multiplied by Absolute Error
(ITAE). An artificial intelligence (AI) method of particle swarm optimization (PSO)
algorithm and Fuzzy Logic for tuning the optimal proportional-integral derivative (PID)
controller parameters for industrial processes. In order to improvise the performance of
supplying power of a power system, error function is minimised. To optimize the gain
values of controller, the PSO algorithm and Fuzzy Logic is used. Tuning of controllers
are done in order to get the gain values or controller parameters such that the desired
frequency and power interchange with systems is maintained within specific value.
